![alt text](hass.png "Home Assistant Screenshot")

## About
This is the configuration for my personal [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) instance. HASS is installed in Docker and this config requires a few more contianers. [Mosquitto](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-mosquitto),[NGINX](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx), and [Xbox-Smartglass-REST-Python](https://hub.docker.com/r/williamson10/xbox-smartglass-rest-python).

The Xbox Smartglass container was authored by [OpenXbox](https://github.com/OpenXbox/xbox-smartglass-rest-python). I used their Dockerfile and built it on Docker Hub.
